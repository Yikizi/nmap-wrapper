# Nmap Wrapper

## Problem
Currently nmap is difficult to use. There are 115 different flags and those flags take also arguments.

All of this is alot and it is for sure difficult to remember all of this.

There are over 3000 lines in the manpage, which makes it hard to navigate.

## Idea
We plan to make a nmap CLI tool, that will solve these problems.

HOW???? - you may ask, by providing:
- [ ] Interactive interface
- [ ] Tab completion
- [ ] Inline documentation
- [ ] Smart suggestions
- [ ] maybe additions?

## Used technologies
- [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) (obviously)
- [go-prompt](https://github.com/c-bata/go-prompt) (for creating CLI tool)

## Contibutors
- [Yikizi](https://github.com/Yikizi)
- [RasmusRaasuke](https://github.com/RasmusRaasuke)
